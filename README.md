# wp_CVE-2020-35489_checker

## CVE-2020-35489 - Introduction

The wp_CVE-2020-35489_checker is a Python command-line tool designed to check if a WordPress website is vulnerable to CVE-2020-35489. This particular vulnerability stems from a security flaw in the WordPress Contact Form 7 plugin versions before 5.3.2. It enables unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious scripts via form fields, due to insufficient input validation and sanitization, potentially leading to remote code execution on the affected site.

## How to use this tool

### Install the necessary dependencies

```
python -m pip install aiofiles aiohttp packaging
```

### Run the script

```
python cve_2020_35489_checker.py -h
usage: cve_2020_35489_checker.py [-h] [-d DOMAIN] [-i INPUT_FILE] [-o OUTPUT_FILE]

  -i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
                        Check multiple sites from a text file (Example: python cve_2020_35489_checker.py -i list.txt -o vulnerable.txt)
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Output file for the list of vulnerable sites
 ```
